In this note, details and functions of the code will be introduced:

The whole function of this code is to find the corresponding heading angle and pitch angle between the two given coordinate points.

This code is divided into three parts:
First one is to build a mathematical model of the earth, and convert the longitude, latitude and altitude of the two coordinate points 
into XYZ coordinate points on the Cartesian coordinate system with the earth's spherical center as the origin.

line 7-8 show the two points with latitude, longitude and altitude respectively, which are required to be input by user.
line 20-22 build the ,athematical model of earth which convert input to be points in Cartesian coordinate.
line 24-26 capture the corresponding x, y and z values after convertion.

The second part is to calculate the pitch angle.

line 35-36 show how to calculate the numerator and denominator of the cosine value of pitch angle respectively.
line 38-42 discuss the output of pitch angle under condition that whether point1 has higher altitude than point2.

The last part is to calculate the heading angle.

line 53-56 show how to calculate the heading angle by values captured in line 50-51.
line 58-70 discuss the output of azimuth by four different directions. But actually, the heading angle ranges from 0 to 360 degree, 
so that we do not have to consider different quadrants when calculate the heading angle.
